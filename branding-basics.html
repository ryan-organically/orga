      <p class="blog-p1 first-line">Starting a brand can be scary. <br><br>Deciding on an original name, colors, logo, and website that speak to you (and to your target market) are big commitments.</p>
      <p class="blog-p1">But surrounding your offering with a brand should be an enthralling, fulfilling experience. <br><br>Some people don&#x27;t know how to begin, or their fear of being &#x27;set in stone&#x27; prevents them from starting in the first place. </p>
      <p class="blog-p1">The following are the basics of the visual presentation of a business. Most industries should be able to go by the following 4 pillars.<br><br>My job is to eliminate the unknown for you, and I&#x27;ll do that here.</p><img src="images/Untitled_Artwork.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="images/Untitled_Artwork-p-500.jpg 500w, images/Untitled_Artwork-p-800.jpg 800w, images/Untitled_Artwork-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/Untitled_Artwork-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/Untitled_Artwork.jpg 1920w" alt="" class="wide-image">
      <h2 id="what-is-squarespace" class="blog-h2">Hopefully you already have an offering</h2>
      <p class="blog-p1">Your offering, whether it&#x27;s a service or a product, should always be viewed from the target market’s perspective. You&#x27;ve heard this before. <br><br>What problem are you solving for them? What are you making <a href="#" class="bold-1">dramatically </a>easier for them? Why does using your offering make more sense than what they already use? <br><br>It should fill a gap in your local area or in your target customer’s everyday life. More importantly it should fit into their repertoire &amp; routine easily. </p>
      <p class="blog-p1">However, this blog is about creating a brand, assuming you already have an offering. That being said, I recognize 4 large decisions that orbit your offering when creating a business:<br>‍<br>•Your name<br>•Your colors<br>•Your logo<br>•Your website<br></p>
      <p class="blog-p1 block-quote-1 small">For SAAS, startups, &amp; others, there&#x27;s obviously much more to think about when it comes to funding, budget, staffing, accounting, legal, and infinite other boring matters. I&#x27;m only here to talk about the fun stuff!</p>
      <h2 id="what-is-squarespace" class="blog-h2">How to come up with a good business name</h2>
      <p class="blog-p1">Assuming you have an offering, deciding on a name should be the first/next important decision you make. The best advice I can give here is to go with your gut.<br><br>Keep it simple. You want to be named something that&#x27;s easy to remember. If your last name is 5 syllables long, consider using a play on words instead. Short. Sweet. Memorable.<br><br>For local business, people often go with namesakes like The Johnson Brothers Plumbing. Or a catchy phrase like <a href="https://www.superfoaminsulation.com/" class="blink-1">Superfoam Insulation</a>. </p>
      <h2 id="what-is-squarespace" class="blog-h3">Should I trademark my business name?</h2>
      <p class="blog-p1">This is not legal counsel, but it’s suggested that you do some research to see if the name you want is taken as a live trademark. You can <a href="https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/search/search-information" class="blink-1">search the US Patent &amp; Trademark Database</a> and set filters to make sure you’re not infringing on someone&#x27;s trademark in your industry. <br><br>Again, this is not legal advice, but I believe you can have a similar name to a trademark if your industry is completely different from that of the trademarked name. <br><br>For example there are plenty of trademarks that exist and contain “Organically,” but they pertain to different industries than my main offerings of SEO &amp; Web Design like cosmetics and agriculture.</p>
      <h2 id="what-is-squarespace" class="blog-h3">Crafting business name ideas</h2><img src="images/Screenshot-2024-05-17-145813.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1177px) 100vw, 1177px" srcset="images/Screenshot-2024-05-17-145813-p-500.png 500w, images/Screenshot-2024-05-17-145813-p-800.png 800w, images/Screenshot-2024-05-17-145813-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Screenshot-2024-05-17-145813.png 1177w" alt="" class="wide-image">
      <p class="blog-p1">To spark some ideas, you can try services like <a href="https://namelix.com/" class="blink-1">Namelix</a>. Namelix produces AI generated names, based on your description, that play on words &amp; generate inspiration for different brand moods, logo styles, and color vibes. <br><br>Your name, colors, logo, &amp; website should all blend together when drumming up the mood you want to portray. <br><br>Mood is important because it&#x27;s the emotions your audience is feeling: the experience when interacting with your brand.<br><br>These are important decisions but it&#x27;s best to pick something and keep moving. It&#x27;s not always advisable, but you can pivot later if something no longer speaks to your vision.</p>
      <h3 id="what-is-webflow-1" class="blog-h2">Choosing business colors</h3>
      <p class="blog-p1">Now that you have a name, you need to start thinking about colors.</p>
      <p class="blog-p1">Think about the mood you want your audience to exhibit when using your brand. What experience do you want to create?</p><img src="images/Firefly-choosing-a-brand-website-graphic-person-thinking-about-logo-colors-48973.jpg" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 2304px) 100vw, 2304px" srcset="images/Firefly-choosing-a-brand-website-graphic-person-thinking-about-logo-colors-48973-p-500.jpg 500w, images/Firefly-choosing-a-brand-website-graphic-person-thinking-about-logo-colors-48973-p-800.jpg 800w, images/Firefly-choosing-a-brand-website-graphic-person-thinking-about-logo-colors-48973-p-1080.jpg 1080w, images/Firefly-choosing-a-brand-website-graphic-person-thinking-about-logo-colors-48973-p-1600.jpg 1600w, images/Firefly-choosing-a-brand-website-graphic-person-thinking-about-logo-colors-48973-p-2000.jpg 2000w, images/Firefly-choosing-a-brand-website-graphic-person-thinking-about-logo-colors-48973.jpg 2304w" alt="" class="wide-image">
      <div class="blog-p1">Look up what colors you like, what themes and emotions those colors convey, and decide if that’s how you’d like to be viewed by the end user. <br><br>Choose colors that are aligned with your message and not ones that could work against you <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/color-meanings?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=SS-GoogleSearch-Nonbrand-DynamicSearchAds-Tier1&amp;utm_term=aud-519773332254:dsa-45211625058___491754501325__&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwmYCzBhA6EiwAxFwfgIqJRmELRsbJObp_dSFRgW8g0-n3hoetOyZ-FlEsFPmhO3EC66cqrhoCDGgQAvD_BwE" class="blink-1">(Webflow)</a>. <br><br>It&#x27;s said that colors elicit specific emotions out of your users. For example, orange and yellow can exude joy &amp; energy from an audience. Purple radiates royalty and tranquility.</div>
      <h3 id="what-is-webflow-1" class="blog-h3">How many brand colors should I have?</h3>
      <div class="blog-p1">You can choose different shades of 1 color, a mix of 2 complimentary colors, or a whole ass palette of 3-7 colors that will represent your company. <br><br>If you&#x27;re stuck and can&#x27;t decide, I urge you to look into <a href="#" class="blink-1">color theory</a> in the context of user interactions.  <br><br>You can use a random palette generator like <a href="http://coolors.co" class="blink-1">coolors.co</a> to generate infinite palettes until one speaks to you. </div>
      <h3 id="what-is-webflow-1" class="blog-h2">How to make a business logo</h3>
      <div class="blog-p1">Once colors have been set, a logo is next in line. <br><br>Think about where this logo will be seen when considering contrast and colors. <br><br>Flat, rectangular-sized logos can be seen on the top left of websites, or wrapped onto a truck or box trailer. <br><br>Circular or square logos can appear on merch, website icons or backgrounds, &amp; social profile pictures. A good <a href="https://www.organicallyseo.com/branding" class="blink-1">logo designer</a> can draw up digital graphics and shapes based on your vision, and slowly mould your idea into a nice visual.</div>
      <div class="blog-p1 block-quote-1 small">AI logo generators are good for inspiration but the copyright and legal implications are a bit murky still. Hopefully, I can design a few more logos for people before they take my job.</div>
      <h3 id="what-is-webflow-1" class="blog-h3">Typography logos</h3>
      <div class="blog-p1">If you want a typography logo, or a logo that&#x27;s a word, you’ll want to use the same font for main headings on the website to echo your brand mood.<br><br>Matching marketing &amp; website content to your logo font boasts consistency &amp; boosts recognition.</div><img src="images/Screenshot-2024-06-06-114222.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px" srcset="images/Screenshot-2024-06-06-114222-p-500.png 500w, images/Screenshot-2024-06-06-114222-p-800.png 800w, images/Screenshot-2024-06-06-114222.png 925w" alt="" class="wide-image">
      <div class="blog-p1">To draft a type logo, go to <a href="http://dafont.com" class="blink-1">Dafont.com</a> and filter for 100% free. Here you can download fonts and use them for marketing, logo, and website content. <br><br>Designers tend to keep <span class="text-span-37">serif fonts</span> (fonts with curly q’s or accents) as headings and <span class="text-span-38">sans-serif</span> (fonts with no added curves) for longer text (or vice versa).<br><br>I&#x27;m using sans serif for both my headings and paragraph text right now. Some say sans serif should always be used for long text, but many books are written in serif.<br><br>The key here is to be consistent. You should not have all <span class="text-span-37">serif fonts</span> for headings on one page, and <span class="text-span-38">sans serif</span> for headings on another part of your website. </div>
      <div class="blog-p1 blog-callout-2">The key here is to be consistent. You should not have all <span class="text-span-37">serif fonts</span> for headings on one page, and <span class="text-span-38">sans serif</span> for headings on another part of your website. </div>
      <div class="blog-p1">The majority of websites sport 2 or 3 fonts. </div>
      <h4 id="what-is-webflow-1" class="blog-h4">How to make a business website</h4>
      <div class="blog-p1">The next step is to <a href="https://www.organicallyseo.com/web-design" class="blink-1">design a custom website</a> that’s aligned with your vision.<br><br>Websites are opportunities for your audience to experience your company before actually using your offering. A good website is obvious with its rhetoric, interactive, personal, and to-the-point.</div>
      <h4 id="what-is-webflow-1" class="blog-h4">How to make a company website</h4>
      <div class="blog-p1">To start a business website, you need to choose a platform, a hosting service, and buy a custom domain. I use Webflow because they offer a designing platform and integrated hosting. <br><br>Using Webflow allows you to customize nearly any aspect of HTML, CSS, and Javascript with no prior coding knowledge. I call it “photoshop for websites.”<br><br>Their platform is taught for free on YouTube &amp; on Webflow University with swathes of informational and educational content. Their content is actually fun to learn, and the way it&#x27;s taught is hilarious.<br><br>No-code platforms allow you to customize pre-made website templates, but they&#x27;re often quite generic. <br><br>I’d always suggest hiring a professional designer to create a custom, memorable website. If you’re set on DIY, you can use Webflow, Wix, or others to buy a website template and make it your own. </div>
      <div class="blog-p1">They should include your most important <a href="https://www.organicallyseo.com/keywords-content" class="blink-1">SEO keywords</a> so they can show up on search engines. Websites should limit whitespace by having some background contrast with large shapes or texture. </div>
      <h2 id="what-is-webflow-1" class="blog-h2">How to find website keywords</h2>
      <div class="blog-p1">To ensure your website will eventually get traffic from search engines, you need to implement the right keywords as headings and main ideas. You can find website keywords to use by researching search volume and ranking difficulty.<br><br>Any search that a person makes on Google, for a specific inquiry, contributes to Search Volume (SV). The amount of websites that are trying to answer that inquiry contributes to Keyword Difficulty (KD).<br><br>You&#x27;ll want to use a keyword software to show you information on keywords to include in your website. There are free keyword research tools like <a href="#" class="blink-1">Ahrefs Free Keyword Generator Tool; </a>there&#x27;s also keyword metrics inside Google Ads.</div><img src="images/Screenshot-2024-06-06-144643.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" srcset="images/Screenshot-2024-06-06-144643-p-500.png 500w, images/Screenshot-2024-06-06-144643.png 594w" alt="" class="wide-image">
      <div class="blog-p1">Keyword research should be done to determine what headings you should have on your site. Many companies have had websites for years, but they&#x27;re just floating out at sea with no traffic. <br><br>You need to do your SEO due diligence or <a href="seo.html" class="blink-1">hire someone</a> to set your website on the right path.<br><br>Website homepages should not be text heavy. Or, if you have a lot of content to explain, use a bunch of smaller blurbs of text, spaced out in different sections. No one wants to be hit with a wall of text like the one I&#x27;m typing right now. Make it easy and entertaining for someone to experience your website.</div>
      <h4 id="what-is-webflow-1" class="blog-h4">That&#x27;s it I guess</h4>
      <div class="blog-p1">Hope you&#x27;re ready to start a brand from scratch! To recap, we went over:<br>‍<br>• what an offering is<br>• what to think about when deciding on colors and a logo<br>• typography &amp; font<br>• how to get a website &amp; kickstart SEO</div>
